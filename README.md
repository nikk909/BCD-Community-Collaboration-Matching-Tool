## Overview

The BCD Community Collaboration Matching Tool is an intelligent partner-finding system that helps community members quickly locate collaboration partners based on keywords. The system shows how well potential partners match your needs and how frequently they've discussed related topics. After collaboration, members can rate each other to build "collaboration credit scores," making it easier to find reliable partners in the future.

### Core Concept

In the BCD community, use **"keywords"** to quickly find collaboration partners. You can see:
- How well they match your needs
- How many times they've discussed related topics

Choose who you want to work with, and the system will set up a temporary group. After collaborating, rate each other to earn "collaboration credit scores"—making it easier to find reliable partners later.

---

## Core Problems

We're solving three critical challenges:

1. **Hard to Find Partners**: To find like-minded partners in the community, you either spam group chats or struggle to find precise matches
2. **Uncertain Reliability**: You can't tell if someone really understands the topic or if they're reliable to work with
3. **No Feedback System**: No feedback after collaboration—good partners aren't marked, so you have to start from scratch next time

---

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Send a Request**: Share a keyword + how you want to collaborate via WhatsApp
   - Example: "Looking for someone to chat about 'solar investment' for a 1-on-1 discussion"
   - Example: "Looking for 3 people to do 'Crypto joint investment'"

2. **Automatic Matching**: The system automatically finds community members who:
   - Often talk about this topic
   - Match your needs
   - Shows you "who fits best and how many times they've discussed related content"

3. **Pick Partners**: Review the matching list and select the people you think are right

4. **Automatic Group Creation**: Once they agree, a temporary group is created automatically for direct communication

5. **Rate & Score**: After the collaboration, rate each other. Scores are stored in your community account—higher scores mean you'll be more likely to be found by others in the future
